When spoken, numbers in MiwƒÅfu are spelled out with a leading particle to indicate that it is a number.

Numbers
================================

Arabic | Syllable
-----: | :-------
0      | fu
1      | pa
2      | re
3      | chi
4      | mo
5      | ku
6      | za
7      | ge
8      | hi
9      | to

Numeral Particle
================================

The beginning of a number series is indicated by `we`.

	we parechi
	[numeral] 123
	123

The end of a numerical sequence is either a pause between words or `nwe`.

	we parechi nwe
	[numeral] 123 [end-numeral]
	123

Scales
================================

With large numbers, over four digits, the typical convention is to write them out with a space or letter between each group of three.

	we parechi moku
	[numeral] 123 45

To simplify numbers, `do` is used to indicate three zeros.

	padochi
	1 000 2
	10,002

In addition to `do`, there are additional scale syllables used for large numbers.

Zeros | Description | Syllable
----: | :-------    | :-------
    1 | Ten         | mya
    2 | Hundred     | pyu
    3 | Thousand    | do
    6 | Million     | kya
    9 | Billion     | jyo
   12 | Trillion    | shyo

Like `do`, these can easily be combined together to indicate more zeros.

	pa jyo re
	pa dododo re
	1 000000000 2
	10,000,000,002
 
These can be combined together:

	pa doshyo
	1 [thousand] [trillion]
	1 quadrillion
	1,000,000,000,000,000

To do numbers like the English phrase "one thousand and one", see *Mathematics* below.

Decimals
================================

The decimal indicator is `rya`.

	paryapa
	pa rya pa
	1.1

Negatives
================================

If the leading `we` is suffixed by `-yo`, it indicates a negative number.

	weyo pa
	[numeral-negative] 1
	-1

Mathematics
================================

Simple math, addition and subtraction, is done with additional suffixes. `-yo` is used for subtracting values.

	we pa weyo re
	[numeral] 1 [numeral-negative] 2 [end-numeral]
	1 - 2
	-1

For addition, `-ko` is used.

	we pa weko re
	[numeral] 1 [numeral-positive] 2 [end-numeral]
	1 + 2
	3

In a series of math, only the final needs a `nwe` if one is required.

	we pa weyo re nwe
	[numeral] 1 [numeral-negative] 2 [end-numeral]
	1 - 2
	-1
