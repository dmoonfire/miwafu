title: Syllables

The basic units of Miwāfu are syllables. These are represented as a single glyph in the written language and spoken as a single unit. They are also the basis of the penultimate accent on the final word of a phrase.

Penultimate Accents
===================

For the penultimate (second to the last) syllable of the final word in a phrase, there is an accent which identifies the gender. This gender can be literal (as with most creatures) or representative of scope.

a   | e   | i   | o   | u   | Typical meanings
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------------------------------------
à   | è   | ì   | ò   | ù   | Masculine, wild, larger, power
ā   | ē   | ī   | ō   | ū   | Child, neutral, many
á   | é   | í   | ó   | ú   | Feminine, control, smaller, accurate

While "n" can be a syllable on its own, it is never used in the penultimate location.

When listed in dictionaries and word lists, accents are in the above order (masculine, neuter, female).

Design Notes
============

The primary reason that "n" cannot be accented is technical. It is very difficult to find a font that handles macron accents over vowels correctly, but almost impossible to find one that handles acute, grave, and macro accents on "n".
